        <p>Horray! You pick the left door, which leads to the treasure room. After looking around for a bit, a piece of paper in a glass case caught your attention. You observe the art and realize it is a map that will guide you to the lost treasure.
             Uh oh. When you grab the map out of the case, it detonates an explosion that will eventually sink the island into the ocean.
